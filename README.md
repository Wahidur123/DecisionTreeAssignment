# Decision Tree Assignment

This repository contains a collection of Python programs demonstrating Decision Tree Classifier and Regressor models using **scikit-learn**. The code includes training, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and visualization.

## Features
- Train and evaluate a **Decision Tree Classifier**
- Train and evaluate a **Decision Tree Regressor**
- Hyperparameter tuning using **GridSearchCV**
- Feature importance visualization
- Confusion matrix visualization using **Seaborn**
- Cost Complexity Pruning (CCP)
- Handling categorical features and missing values

## Requirements
Make sure you have Python and the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
